Collaborative Drawing :  Users can draw, erase, and annotate on a shared whiteboard in real time, enabling collaboration across different locations.
Drawing Tools: Includes a variety of tools such as pen, eraser, shapes (circle, square), and color customization options for users to personalize their drawings.
Real-Time Synchronization : Achieved seamless real-time updates using WebSocket (or Socket.io), ensuring that every userâ€™s input is reflected instantly on all connected devices.
Interactive User Interface : Designed an intuitive interface using CSS, with interactive controls for users to switch between tools, change colors, and clear the board.
Save and Export : Users can save their work as an image file (PNG/JPEG) or export the drawing for further use.
Responsive Design : Ensured the whiteboard is accessible across devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones, for a consistent user experience.
This project showcases expertise in front-end development, real-time communication, and collaborative web applications.
